# Match Predictor Project Plan

## Goal:
Build a football match prediction system based on recent team stats and basic logic.

## Phase 1 (Now):
- User inputs two teams
- Inputs their last 5 match results (W/D/L)
- Inputs average goals scored/conceded
- Simple formula calculates predicted winner

## Phase 2:
- Include home/away logic
- Assign points for form (e.g., W = 3, D = 1, L = 0)
- Display win % confidence

## Phase 3:
- Use real data (e.g., from API or scraped source)
- Maybe add GUI later

## Why:
To build Python skills and turn Peakfits into a football + tech brand.

## Next Steps:
- Finish README ✅
- Build plan.md ✅
- Start basic Python input/output script (next phase)
