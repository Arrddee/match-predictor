# Match Predictor

This is a simple football match predictor using Python.

The goal is to learn how to:
- Collect and handle match stats (like goals, form, etc.)
- Apply simple logic to predict match outcomes
- Build up to more advanced versions later (maybe with AI or data APIs)

Built by Richard (Peakfits) as part of a 90-day challenge to combine tech, football passion, and brand building.
